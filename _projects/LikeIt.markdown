Online anything-rating system - an ASP.NET MVC project The idea of LikeIt is for anyone to be able to express their opinion 
about a certain thing by giving their vote for or against it. A person can register a page in any category - from business
to favorite food or hobby and let other people vote for it, turning the application into a platform for opinions. It's
a project done as part of my education at Telerik Software Academy and is still a work in progress.
