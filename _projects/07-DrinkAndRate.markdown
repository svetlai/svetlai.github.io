Drink and Rate
</h3>

<div>Online beer rating system</div> 
<div>
The application was created as a team project for Telerik Software Academy's <b>ASP.NET Web Forms</b> course. 
Anyone can register a certain brand of beer, leave a comment, rate it and let others do the same. 
There are also articles, charts and events sections, where people can get more information about the on-goings 
in the beer world.
