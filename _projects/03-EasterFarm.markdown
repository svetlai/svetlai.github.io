Easter Farm
</h3>
<div>
A single-player arcade game - a team project for Telerik Academy 2015's <b>Object-oriented Programming</b> course

Hans, lambs and bunnies running in a farm, eating berries and producing Easter eggs and milk. 
Easter presents made in a present factory from ingredients bought from a market place. 
Wolves and foxes, sneaking in the farm, trying to steal all the livestock and ruin Easter. Intrigued yet?
